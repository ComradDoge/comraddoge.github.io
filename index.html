        If VANILLA or SHATTERED is noted before the rule, it means the rule is only specific to that specific version.
        If there are neither of them that means the rule is in force in all occasions.

        <h1>III. Subjects</h1>
        Anbennar: Vassal and PU rules are less strict and for the gamemaster to decide.
        <ol>
             <li>If a player is VASSALIZED they have TRUCE(if any)+10 years period to break free (declare war). If they don?t or fail they are considered dead and must leave it.
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>As the overlord do not enforce a new religion while a player is still present even if it is desired. You are not friends but enemies.</li>
             <li>During the peace deal the vassal can only request independence</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
             <li>If a player falls into PERSONAL UNION, they have a TRUCE (if any) +30 year period to break free (declare war). If they don?t or fail they are considered dead and must leave it.
        <ol>
             <li>The PU is not to help the overlord in their wars.</li>
             <li>The PU does not count to the alliance count</li>
             <li>As the overlord do not enforce a new religion while a player is still present even if it is desired. You are not friends but enemies.</li>
             <li>During the peace deal the PU can only request independence</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
             <li>Player tributaries do not count as a vassalization, however to tributary someone you need to border them (with a vassal, another tributary or directly).</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h1>IV. Diplomacy</h1>
        <ol>
             <li>Truce breaking and no-CBs against players are not allowed.</li>
             <li>No mid-War alliance joining - you are allowed to ally player nations that are at war, but you are not allowed to join their war that has been started before you allied with them.</li>
             <li>When is GP status given:
        <ol>
             <li>VANILLA: If you are a Holy Roman Emperor as Austria or Bohemia until 1500</li>
             <li>If you are 1-8 GP slot in the Great Power list.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>4. Player Alliances</h5>
        SHATTERED: This rule does not come into effect until 1500, due to the quick changing landscape in early game. Until then you are limited to 2 player alliances.
        
        Player alliances are limited by the cost of diplomatic relations depending on YOUR country's status. This does not care about any of your AI alliances, only what YOUR empty base number of diplo relations is.
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>For GPs (1 to 8th) any player alliance will cost 3 diplomatic relations to have 1 player alliance.</li>
             <li>For non-GPs (9th to Beyond) any player alliance will cost 2 diplomatic relations to have 1 player alliance.</li>
             <li>Colonial Players cost 1 diplomatic relation as subjects until 500 development, after which they cost 2 slots.</li>
             <li>Guarantees cost the same as a normal alliance, but only for the guarantor.</li>
        </ol>
        Example: YOU are a GP and have 4 (minimum) diplomatic relation slots. A player alliance costs 3 points, meaning YOU can only have 1 player ally because for a second ally you need 3 more points (6 total diplo points) but you only have (4-3) 1 point left. This does not care about any of your AI alliances, only what YOUR empty base number of diplomatic relations is. A non-GP with 4 diplomatic relations is able to get 2 player allies because they only cost 2 each for them. While the other player if they are a GP must consider if they have the points to have them as an ally and if its worth it.

        <h1>V. Military</h1>
        <ol>
             <li>Players may not hire or offer condottiere (to players or AIs) to hinder another players war (whether they are fighting against AI or another player) until 1st of January 1500 or until the Italian Wars event starts.
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>Single regiment to spectate is allowed</li>
             <li>Condottieri can only be transported with fleets (transports) that are part of the same war. The enemy should be capable of intercepting the fleet.</li>

        <h1>VI. Peace Deals</h1>
        The formula below is used when wanting to force peace <b>AS AN ATTACKER</b>. Defender use the same formula if they are winning the war and want to take provinces but they can also use 6.1 rules to <b>FORCE WHITE PEACE</b> out earlier than an attacker could.
        
        You can only take provinces you or your allies occupy, unless the defender agrees otherwise due to some agreement.

        This rule is basically used for colonial nations fighting old world countries that don't deal with their new world provinces or island territories over all. This allows them a de jure way to peace out and gain land.

        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>When you use a ?claim province? CB, you can force a peace deal for provinces within the state up to 20% warscore, if you meet all these requirements:
        <ol>
             <li>10% Warscore</li>
             <li>You have occupied the whole state the enemy controls for 5 years consecutively. If it gets re-occupied the timer resets.</li>

             <li>If a player nation is protected, any player that gets into a war with that nation must white peace as soon as possible. If any issues arise please note them.</li>
             <li>If a protected nation declares an offensive war on another player (because the AI settings weren?t set) they are free to make a peace deal they want but be reasonable if possible
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>This does not mean that people are allowed to declare them. The country is still protected.</li>

             <li>Protected regions are not allowed to be expanded into</li>
             <li>Players who spawned in those regions are protected</li>
             <li>Protected players can expand outside of protected region and they still cannot be declared on</li>
             <li>If a protected player declares an offensive player war, land can be taken from them no matter what region it is. Protection is still in place and so unless they declare again you cannot take land.</li>

             <li>Permission from the overlord is given.</li>

        </ol>
        </li>
             <li>CN can only declare when they have 55% or more liberty desire.</li>

        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>Ideas can only be changed to the same monarch category and the player must assign the number of ideas that the new idea group should have so there is no confusion if there are two military idea groups that are not fully filled out.</li>
             <li>Government reforms can also be changed but you must write which ones</li>
             <li>When someone new joins 15 year protection is in place or until they declare a player offensive war.
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>If players end up in a war due to AI, the protected player gets the right to request to white peace out.
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
             <li>However, they can also defend AI land and fight the war.
